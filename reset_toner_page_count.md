# Reset Toner Page Count

I have a Brother HL-3170CDW color laser printer.  It came with the "starter" toner cartridges that these printers commonly come with, the idea being to include just enough toner to last the expected user a few months before they'll need to go buy the "full" toner in order to keep printing.  I print pretty infrequently, so that initial toner has lasted me several years.  However, a few days ago the printer started refrusing to print anymore, claiming that the toner was too low.  I hadn't noticed any degredation of print quality, so I assume that this was probably based on some hard count of number of pages that this type of toner cartridge was allowed to print.  I found [these instructions](https://networkhobo.com/reset-toner-counter-on-brother-hl-3170cdw/) for reseting the count, which worked great for me.  I'm duplicating those instructions below just in case this page should disappear the next time this issue comes up.

1. Open the top lid of the printer and leave ajar.
1. Press and hold the “Secure” and “X Cancel” buttons.
1. Use the arrow keys to select the cartridge model you would like to reset and press “OK”.
1. Press the UP arrow to reset the cartridge.
1. Once reset is selected you will see “ACCEPTED” on the screen.
